## [0.3.27] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **#87** macOS SIGKILL on binary replace: `trusty-search start` now exits with an error if a daemon is already running; `make install` and `make patch` stop the daemon before reinstalling the binary
- **#82** Memory limit enforcement during reindex: tier-based hard caps on `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` env-var overrides (Medium=64, Large=128, XLarge=256) prevent RSS spikes from misconfigured batch sizes; existing background RSS poller confirmed active
- **#89** ORT ONNX arena pre-allocation: confirmed mitigated by `with_arena_allocator(false)`; tier hard caps add defense-in-depth

### Improved
- **#88** Intent classifier now recognises domain-term Definition queries: PascalCase/CamelCase identifiers, and standalone "definition"/"interface"/"schema"/"type"/"enum"/"model" trigger Definition intent
- **#91** Compound noun classifier: CamelCase compound noun queries (e.g. "QueryClassifier intent classification") now route to Definition intent instead of Unknown
- **#92** Definition-intent ranking: `.md`/`.toml`/`.json`/`.yaml` files scored at 0.5× in RRF fusion for Definition intent only; source files rank first for symbol lookups
- **#94** KG expansion: results merged by score before `take(top_k)`; `hybrid+kg` match_reason now surfaces on large indexes

---

## [0.1.46] — 4 indexing speed optimizations

### Performance
- **INT8 quantized model**: switch fastembed model to `AllMiniLML6V2Q` (INT8 quantized); same 384-dim output, ~30% faster ONNX inference
- **Batch upsert**: accumulate HNSW vectors across all chunks in a reindex pass and call a single `UsearchStore::upsert_batch` instead of N individual inserts; eliminates per-chunk lock overhead
- **Split lock** (`parse_and_embed_files` / `commit_parsed_batch`): parsing + embedding now runs outside the write lock; the write lock is held only for the final redb + HNSW commit, enabling higher concurrency
- **Batch size 512**: increase ONNX batch size 256 → 512 for better GPU/NEON/AVX2 saturation
- Combined target: **< 2 min on a 14k-file repo** (down from ~2–4 min after v0.1.34)

---

## [0.1.45] — multi-line progress + blue-green verify + incremental index

### Added
- **Multi-line progress display**: `indicatif::MultiProgress` shows concurrent bars — one per active reindex stream — plus a summary line with aggregate `chunks/s`
- **Blue-green verify**: after a reindex completes, a lightweight verification pass confirms the new HNSW index answers a canary query before swapping the live handle; prevents silent corruption on large repos
- **Incremental index flag** (`--incremental`, default on): skips files whose sha2 fingerprint matches the stored value even across daemon restarts; `--force` still triggers a full rebuild

---

## [0.1.44] — async HTTP server in trusty-common

### Added
- `trusty-common`: `server` module with `with_standard_middleware` (axum-server feature) and `daemon_http_client` helper
- `trusty-search-service`: `build_router` uses `with_standard_middleware`
- `main.rs`: all daemon HTTP call sites use `trusty_common::server::daemon_http_client`

---

## [0.1.43] — HTTP timeouts (fix status hang)

### Fixed
- Add 2s connect / 5s request timeouts to all daemon HTTP calls via `daemon_client()` helper; `status`, `health`, `doctor`, `query`, and `reindex` now fail fast with a clear error instead of hanging when the daemon is not running

---

## [0.1.42] — status/health unified + doctor command

### Added
- `status` and `health` are now aliases for the same `run_status()` handler; output shows daemon version, port, and per-index chunk counts
- `trusty-search doctor`: 6-check diagnostic (daemon liveness, model cache, data-dir writability, stale lockfile, empty indexes, port reachability) with colored ✓/⚠/✗ output
- `doctor --fix`: auto-repairs stale lockfile and empty indexes via `run_reindex` with progress bar; exits 1 on any error

---

## [0.1.41] — `index` primary command + indicatif progress bar

### Added
- `trusty-search index [PATH] [--name <id>] [--force]`: auto-registers the index if absent, skips if already indexed, `--force` triggers full reindex; replaces the awkward `init` + `reindex` two-step
- `indicatif` progress bar during reindex: `⟳ Indexing {id} [████░░] {pos}/{len} files — {eta} remaining`; updates on each SSE batch event, finishes with chunk count and elapsed time
- `register_index_with_daemon()` and `fetch_chunk_count()` helpers shared between `Init` and `Index` commands
- `init` and `reindex` preserved as backward-compatible aliases

---

## [0.1.40] — wire shared crates throughout

### Refactored
- `ui.rs`: replace inline OpenRouter HTTP client with `trusty_common::openrouter_chat` (~50 lines removed)
- All three shared crates (`trusty-mcp-core`, `trusty-embedder`, `trusty-common`) fully wired into every consumer
- Pin shared crates to public git tags on `bobmatnyc/trusty-common` (v0.1.0); remove in-tree copies (net −985 LOC)

---

## [0.1.39] — exclude minified JS/build dirs from indexing

### Added
- `should_skip_path()`: skips `*.min.js/css`, `*.bundle.js`, `*.chunk.js`, hashed bundles, binary extensions, files > 1 MB
- `should_skip_content()`: heuristic minification detection for `.js/mjs/cjs` (< 5 lines with any line > 500 chars)
- `SKIP_DIRS`: `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.svelte-kit`, `vendor`, `.gradle`, `.m2`, `coverage`, `.nyc_output`
- Reindex emits SSE `"skip"` event with `reason:"minified"` for content-skipped files
- 14 new tests covering all skip patterns

---

## [0.1.38] — shared crates (trusty-mcp-core, trusty-embedder, trusty-common)

### Added
- `trusty-mcp-core`: `McpRequest`/`McpResponse`/`JsonRpcError`, error code constants, `run_stdio_loop` generic async stdio handler, CORS/Trace axum helpers
- `trusty-embedder`: `Embedder` trait, `FastEmbedder` with LRU cache + persistent model cache dir, `EMBED_DIM=384`, `MockEmbedder` for tests, `embed_one` helper
- `trusty-common`: `bind_with_auto_port`, `resolve_data_dir`/`cache_dir`, `ConcurrentRegistry<K,V>`, `init_tracing`, `maybe_disable_color`
- All three registered in workspace; 163 tests passing

### Refactored
- Adopt shared crates and delete inlined equivalents; `trusty-search-core::embed` becomes a thin facade over the shared `Embedder` trait
- Daemon port binding goes through shared async helper; `main.rs` uses `init_tracing`/`maybe_disable_color`

---

## [0.1.37] — daemon early-exit + model cache

### Fixed
- `is_already_running()` checks lockfile before `FastEmbedder::new()` so "another daemon running" exits in < 1 ms instead of after an 86 MB model download

### Added
- `model_cache_dir()` resolves `~/Library/Caches/trusty-search/models/`; model downloads once and loads from disk on all subsequent daemon starts
- `serial_test` on embed tests prevents `hf_hub` lock-file races in parallel test runs

---

## [0.1.36] — HTTP ↔ MCP functional parity

### Added
- Four missing MCP tools added for full HTTP endpoint coverage:
  - `delete_index` ← `DELETE /indexes/:id`
  - `reindex` ← `POST /indexes/:id/reindex`
  - `index_status` ← `GET /indexes/:id/status`
  - `chat` ← `POST /chat` (OpenRouter proxy)
- `test_tools_list_complete` asserts HTTP/MCP parity; 151 tests passing

---

## [0.1.35] — Svelte admin UI + MCP stdio server

### Added
- **Web management UI** served at `GET /ui`:
  - Collections panel: list/create/delete indexes, reindex with live SSE progress
  - Search panel: single and cross-collection hybrid search, `match_reason` badges, compact/full snippet toggle
  - Chat panel: OpenRouter-backed conversational Q&A (gated by `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
  - Admin panel: daemon info, per-file index/remove ops, danger zone
  - Static assets embedded at compile time via `include_dir`
- `POST /chat` endpoint proxies to OpenRouter with search context injection
- `DELETE /indexes/:id` endpoint
- `trusty-search ui` subcommand: start daemon + open browser
- **MCP stdio JSON-RPC server** (full JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout, protocol 2024-11-05):
  - `initialize` handshake, `notifications/initialized` suppressed correctly
  - `tools/list`: all 6 tools (`search_code`, `index_file`, `remove_file`, `list_indexes`, `create_index`, `search_health`)
  - `tools/call`: MCP-spec content envelope with `isError` flag
  - Graceful shutdown on stdin EOF; errors to stderr only

---

## [0.1.34] — 4× faster indexing

### Performance
- Eliminate 452 symbol-graph rebuilds per reindex: `index_files_batch_no_rebuild` defers graph rebuild to once at completion
- `resolve_callee` O(N×S) linear suffix scan replaced with O(1) hash lookup using precomputed simple-name → `NodeIndex` map
- Batch size 32 → 128 for better ONNX saturation
- `drain` RawChunk corpus instead of cloning (saves ~115k allocations per reindex)
- Expected reduction on large monorepos: ~46 min → 2–4 min

---

## [0.1.33] — hot BM25/HNSW/LRU fixes + CLI stubs

### Fixed
- **Bug A**: Wire `FastEmbedder` + `UsearchStore` in `create_index_handler`; HNSW now actually stores and returns vector results
- **Bug B**: Replace per-query BM25 rebuild with persistent `Arc<RwLock<Bm25Index>>` maintained incrementally at index time; search is O(df_i) not O(corpus)
- **Bug C**: LRU embedding cache now deduplicates across requests (was masked by Bug B)

### Added
- `status` CLI: daemon health + per-index chunk counts
- `query` CLI: `POST /indexes/:id/search` with ranked output or `--json`
- `init` now calls `POST /indexes` on the daemon (fixes misleading "Registered" message)

---

## [0.1.32] — convert command

### Added
- `trusty-search convert project|all`: migrate indexes from mcp-vector-search by reading `.mcp-vector-search/config.json` files
  - `convert project`: git-style upward discovery from CWD
  - `convert all`: scans `~` at depth 6, skipping noise dirs
  - `--dry-run`: preview without contacting the daemon
  - `--concurrency`: bounds parallel migrations via `tokio::Semaphore`
  - Idempotent: existing indexes detected via daemon `{created: false}` response

---

## [0.1.31] — large codebase performance

### Performance
- `CodeIndexer::index_files_batch`: parses N files in parallel via rayon, embeds all chunks in 256-chunk ONNX batches, takes corpus write lock once per batch
- Incremental hash skip: files whose content hash matches the previous reindex are skipped; new SSE events: `"skip"`, `"batch"` (with `chunks_per_sec`), `"complete"` now carries skipped count
- `UsearchStore::with_capacity_hint`: tunes HNSW (connectivity=32, expansion_add=128, expansion_search=64) when expected chunk count > 50k
- `.gradle`/`.groovy`/`.kts`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` added to `SOURCE_EXTS`; Java/Gradle build dirs pruned from walker

---

## [0.1.30] — start/stop CLI

### Added
- `trusty-search start`: starts the HTTP daemon (replaces `daemon`)
- `trusty-search stop`: reads PID from fs4 lockfile, sends SIGTERM, polls up to 5s for port file to disappear

---

## [0.1.29] — reindex + SSE progress streaming

### Added
- `walker::walk_source_files`: walkdir-based, skips `.git`/`target`/`node_modules`/etc.
- `POST /indexes/:id/reindex`: spawns background reindex task with optional `{root_path}` body
- `GET /indexes/:id/reindex/stream`: SSE endpoint emitting `start`/`progress`/`complete`/`error` events with replay buffer for late subscribers
- `trusty-search reindex [PATH]` CLI: connects to SSE stream, renders live percentage/file progress
- `trusty-search add <PATH>`: walks directories and indexes every source file match
- `trusty-search remove <FILE>`: calls `/indexes/:id/remove-file`
- `trusty-search list`: calls `/indexes` and renders registry
